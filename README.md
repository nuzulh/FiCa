Fish is an important commodity in Indonesia. According to Badan Karantina Ikan, Pengendalian Mutu, dan
Keamanan Hasil Perikanan Indonesia in 2015 had a total of 440 endemic freshwater fish species and 140
endemic marine fish species. The variety of fish species makes it difficult for people to identify the type of
fish directly. Different naming in each region adds to the difficulty for the community to know the type of
fish purchased or consumed with certainty. Likewise with the government in recording fishery production
and calculating the national fish stock. Until now, to ascertain the type of fish was only done with
conventional guidelines for classification of fish species or books. This is not efficient and effective because
it can allow errors in determining prices and improper cultivation methods. Our team wants to make it
easier for the public to be able to determine the type of fish accurately and quickly and be able to estimate
the price of the fish.
